# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1 part 1
This was my first lab that I was able to learn a lot from. The reason I would put it in my favorite is because it was fairly simple but it showed me that I am able to code. We had to learn the basics of using git and running code which stuck till the end.

Lab 11 part 2
Lab 11 would be my second favorite lab because it challenged me the most. The most favorite part that I enjoyed from this lab would be the random number generator. I would say this lab was the one I struggled the most but when I was able to understand it I saw the beauty of trail and error


Lab 8 part 2
I enjoyed lab 8 because this is when we started to integrate “Loops”. I would say that loops are one of the more difficult topics we covered in this class. I enjoyed seeing it all work together while learning to understand, and seeing your code work was the best.
